# Taxi Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a taxi dataset using **NumPy**, showcasing the library's efficiency in handling large datasets and performing complex numerical computations. The dataset includes information about trips, fares, distances, and timestamps.

## Features
- Efficient data loading and preprocessing using NumPy.
- Statistical analysis of taxi trips (e.g., average fare, trip distance).
- Extraction of insights such as busiest hours, most common destinations, and fare trends.
- Performance comparisons of NumPy against traditional Python data structures.

##Technologies
- Python: Programming language
- NumPy: Numerical computations
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis
